# Supply Chain Management (SCM), Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) and Optimization in SCM

Welcome to this repository! This README provides an overview of the work and research focused on Supply Chain Management (SCM), Supply Chain Analytics (SCA), and various optimization techniques. Below is a summary of the key areas, including the methods used, problem-solving approaches, and the general workflow for projects.

## Key Topics in Supply Chain Optimization and Analytics

### 1. **Optimization Techniques in Supply Chain Design**
   - Focus on procurement, logistics, and inventory management.
   - Techniques explored include:
     - **Deterministic Optimization**: Known parameters.
     - **Stochastic Optimization**: Deals with uncertain variables.
     - **Robust Optimization**: Solutions that work under varying conditions.
   - These methods streamline operations, reduce costs, and mitigate risks.

### 2. **Linear and Integer Programming**
   - **Linear Programming (LP)**: Solving capacity planning and production scheduling using Simplex and Dual Simplex methods.
   - **Integer Programming (IP)**: Pure and Mixed Integer Programming with Branch and Bound methods.
   - These techniques optimize resource allocation and minimize costs.

### 3. **Network Design**
   - **Shortest Path Problems** and **Network Flow Problems** for optimizing logistics and distribution.

### 4. **Heuristic and Metaheuristic Methods**
   - **Heuristic Methods**: Techniques like Greedy and Local Search.
   - **Metaheuristic Techniques**: Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Ant Colony Optimization for complex supply chain problems.

### 5. **Advanced Optimization Techniques**
   - **Simulation-Based Optimization**: Discrete Event and Monte Carlo Simulation.
   - **Stochastic Programming**: Two-Stage and Multi-Stage models.
   - **Multi-Criteria Optimization**: Pareto Efficiency and Trade-Off Analysis for balanced solutions.

1. **Project Scoping and Objective Setting**
2. **Dataset Creation**: Using Python libraries or Excel.
3. **Data Preprocessing**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Tableau, Power BI, or Python.
6. **Optimization Models**: Deterministic and uncertainty-based.
7. **Simulation and Scenario Analysis**
8. **Second Round of Visualization**
9. **Presentation and Documentation**
10. **Review and Feedback**

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Inventory Management

#### Steps:
1. **Data Generation**: Simulated demand, sales, inventory, and costs.
2. **Optimization Operations**: EOQ, ROP, Safety Stock formulas applied.
3. **Dashboard Comparison**: Showed improvements in stockout rates and cost reductions.

#### Key Formulas:
- **EOQ**: 
  \[
  EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
  \]
- **Reorder Point (ROP)**:
  \[
  ROP = d \times L
  \]
- **Safety Stock**: 
  \[
  Safety\ Stock = Z \times \sigma_L
  \]
